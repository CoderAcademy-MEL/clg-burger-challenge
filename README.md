The final program..

* Allows the user to select a bun, patty, sauce, cheese and fillings for their burger.
* The user can add many burgers to their order.
* The entire order is printed at the end of the program.

Implement pricing...

* all burgers have a base price of 5.00
* each 'filling' costs an extra 0.50
* print the price of each burger, and the total of the order, at the end of the program.

Before writing any code, consider the most appropriate way to organise the new code.

* Where should pricing data be stored?
* Where should burger cost calculations be performed?

# 🌱🌱 More?

* calculate the GST and display it with the order.

# 🏆 OO Burger Challenge

Modify the existing program. There are comments in each file to assist you.

The final program..

* Allows the user to select a bun, patty, sauce, cheese and fillings for their burger.
* The user can add many burgers to their order.
* The entire order is printed at the end of the program.

# 🌱 Optional

Implement pricing...

* all burgers have a base price of 5.00
* each 'filling' costs an extra 0.50

Before writing any code, consider the most appropriate way to organise the new code.

* Where should pricing data be stored?
* Where should burger cost calculations be performed?
